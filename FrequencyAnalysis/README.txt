The directory contains several types of assignment submission.

I personally prefer MATLAB Live scripts, as this format (.mlx) greatly
improves the visibility of what was done and what results were obtained.
In case of problems with display correctness, exported to HTML versions 
have been added. 

Also, just in case, all obtained figures and audio files, as well as 
regular matlab scripts (.m), are also uploaded.
